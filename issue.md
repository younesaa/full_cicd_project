### Issue Report: Maven Clean Plugin Failure in Jenkins Build

**Issue Summary:**
During a Jenkins build job for the `twitter-app` Maven project, the `mvn clean` command initially failed due to an error related to the Maven Clean Plugin. However, further investigation revealed that the issue was related to permissions and non-existent directories.

**Error Details:**

```
[INFO] --- maven-clean-plugin:3.3.2:clean (default-clean) @ twitter-app ---
[INFO] Deleting /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/blogging-app/target
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD FAILURE
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time:  1.547 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2024-09-12T21:48:18Z
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-clean-plugin:3.3.2:clean (default-clean) on project twitter-app: Failed to clean project: Failed to delete /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/blogging-app/target/maven-archiver/pom.properties -> [Help 1]
```

**Detailed Debug Output:**

```
[DEBUG] Skipping non-existing directory /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/blogging-app/target
[DEBUG] Skipping non-existing directory /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/blogging-app/target/classes
[DEBUG] Skipping non-existing directory /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/blogging-app/target/test-classes
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- The error initially appeared to be due to the Maven Clean Plugin's inability to delete certain files or directories.
- Further investigation showed that the target directories either did not exist or were already removed.
- Running Maven with debug logging revealed that the clean operation was ultimately successful.

**Resolution Steps Taken:**
1. **Verified Directory Status:** Checked the existence of the `target` directory and its contents.
2. **Re-ran Build:** Executed the Maven build again to ensure it was not a transient issue.
3. **Checked Permissions:** Ensured that the Jenkins user had appropriate permissions to access and modify the directories.
4. **Updated Maven Configuration:** Reviewed and confirmed that there were no misconfigurations affecting the build process.

**Outcome:**
The issue was resolved by confirming that the directories were correctly handled, and the `mvn clean` command was successful upon re-run. The build process proceeded without further errors.

**Lessons Learned:**
- The importance of understanding Maven plugin operations and directory management.
- The value of running commands with debug logging to uncover underlying issues.
- The need to ensure proper permissions and directory existence before troubleshooting build failures.
